REPEAT               10.5    inches
newdpi                9.5    inches
oldDPI needed         4.85   inches
fractional repeats    9.1    inches

9.1-(10.5-9.5)
9.1-(1)        =8.1

one eyespot is on new sensor
we have 4.8667 repeats between sensors
the last eyespot is 4 repeats back from the front sensor
the last eyespot is 42 inches back from the front sensor
the last eyespot is 51.1-42 inches past back sensor
the last eyespot is 9.1 inches past back sensor

one eyespot is 9.1 inches past new sensor
we have 4.8667 repeats between sensors
	the last eyespot is 4 repeats minus( 9.1 plus fraction) inches back from the front sensor
	the last eyespot is 4 repeats minus (9.1 plus 9.1 ) inches back from the front sensor
	the last eyespot is 42 inches back from the front sensor
	the last eyespot is 51.1-42 inches past back sensor
the last eyespot is 9.1 plus 9.1 inches past back sensor
the last eyespot is 18.2 inches past back sensor
the last eyespot is 18.2 inches minus 10.5 inches past back sensor
the last eyespot is 7.7 inches  past back sensor..............................wrong
