I am trying to add an IO-ATC8 to an existing system.
Below is a list of the system.
The IO-ATC8 does not connect (RUN light continues to flash).
The IO-ATC8 has been added to the hardware configuration in the program.
The IO-ATC8 has been internally set to match the hardware configuration (channel 1 is 0-10v).
I have run BUILD ALL and compile and downloaded.
The IO-ATC8 does not connect (RUN light continues to flash).
